# Varnam Web extension

This is a web extension build over the varnam api. For every text or input field present in the webpage, the webextension makes it transliteratable.

## Bugs
[ ] It is always on, make this togglable.(high priority)  
[ ] It is only being invoked on page start, so if a change in page occurs that introudces a textarea or input field it is not being handled.  
[ ] Contenteditable field might have an issue (verify).
